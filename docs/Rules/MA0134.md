# MA0134 - Observe result of async calls

The result of awaitable method should be observed by using `await`, `Result`, `Wait`, or other methods.

Note: [CS4014](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs4014?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003978) is similar but only operate in `async` methods. MA0134 operates in non-async methods.

````c#
void Sample()
{
    Task.Delay(1); // non-compliant

    Task.Delay(1).Wait(); // ok
    _ = Task.Delay(1);    // ok
}
````
