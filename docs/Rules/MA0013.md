# MA0013 - Types should not extend System.ApplicationException

Exceptions should derive from `System.Exception` or one of its subclasses in the System namespace.

From [the .NET documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.applicationexception?view=netframework-4.7.2&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003978#remarks):

> You should derive custom exceptions from the `System.Exception` class rather than the `ApplicationException` class. You should not throw an `ApplicationException` exception in your code, and you should not catch an `ApplicationException` exception unless you intend to re-throw the original exception.
