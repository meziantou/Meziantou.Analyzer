# MA0025 - Implement the functionality instead of throwing NotImplementedException

The `NotImplementedException` exception is thrown when a particular method, get accessor, or set accessor is present as a member of a type but is not implemented.
If you don't plan to implement the functionality, you should consider using the `NotSupportedException` exception instead.
