# MA0049 - Type name must not match the name of the namespace

For usability, you should not name a type as the namespace. This would be harder to use it in the code.

````csharp
namespace Foo
{
    class Foo // non compliant
    {
    }
}

var foo = new Foo.Foo(); // You must fully qualify the type
````
