````csharp
public class Foo // compliant
{
}

public class Bar : Foo // Non compliant
{
}

// Should be
public sealed class Bar : Foo
{
}
````

# Configuration

Roslyn Analyzer can only know the current project context, not the full solution.
So, it's cannot know if a public class is used in another project. So, it's unsafe to report `public` classes.

````
# .editorconfig file
MA0053.public_class_should_be_sealed = false
````

Classes with `virtual` members cannot be sealed. By default, these classes are not reported. You can enable this rule for classes with `virtual` members using the `.editorconfig`:

````
# .editorconfig file
MA0053.class_with_virtual_member_shoud_be_sealed = false
````

Classes that inherits from `Exception`are not reported by default. You can enable the analyzer for these classes using the `.editorconfig`:

````
# .editorconfig file
MA0053.exceptions_should_be_sealed = false
````
