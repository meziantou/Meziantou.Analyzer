# MA0123 - Sequence number must be a constant

The Blazor difference algorithm relies on the sequence numbers corresponding to distinct lines of code, not distinct call invocations. When creating a component with RenderTreeBuilder methods, hardcode the arguments for sequence numbers. Using a calculation or counter to generate the sequence number can lead to poor performance. For more information, see the [Sequence numbers relate to code line numbers and not execution order section]((https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/advanced-scenarios?view=aspnetcore-6.0&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003978#sequence-numbers-relate-to-code-line-numbers-and-not-execution-order)).
