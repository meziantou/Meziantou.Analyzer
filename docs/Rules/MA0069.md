# MA0069 - Non-constant static fields should not be visible

Static fields that are neither constant nor read-only are not thread-safe. Access to such fields
must be carefully controlled and requires advanced programming techniques for synchronizing access
to the class object. Because these are difficult skills to learn and master, and testing such an
object poses its own challenges, static fields are best used to store data that does not change.
