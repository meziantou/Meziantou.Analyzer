# MA0042 - Do not use blocking calls in an async method

You should replace blocking calls, such as `Wait` or `Result`, with an async call using `await`.

````csharp
public async Task Sample()
{
    Thread.Sleep(1); // Non compliant
    Task.Delay(1).Wait(); // non compliant
    await Task.Delay(1); // compliant

    var result = Task.Run(() => 10).Result; // non compliant
    var result = await Task.Run(() => 10); // compliant
}
````

The rule only reports a diagnostic when the calling method is already `async`. [MA0045](MA0045.md) detects the same cases, but reports them even if applying a fix would require you to change the calling method's signature.
