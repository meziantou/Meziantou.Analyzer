# MA0018 - Do not declare static members on generic types

When a static member of a generic type is called, the type argument must be specified for the type.
When a generic instance member that does not support inference is called, the type argument must be specified for the member.
The syntax for specifying the type argument in these two cases is different and easily confused.
