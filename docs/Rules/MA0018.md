# MA0018 - Do not declare static members on generic types (deprecated; use CA1000 instead)
<!-- sources -->
Source: [DoNotDeclareStaticMembersOnGenericTypes.cs](https://github.com/meziantou/Meziantou.Analyzer/blob/main/src/Meziantou.Analyzer/Rules/DoNotDeclareStaticMembersOnGenericTypes.cs)
<!-- sources -->

When a static member of a generic type is called, the type argument must be specified for the type.
When a generic instance member that does not support inference is called, the type argument must be specified for the member.
The syntax for specifying the type argument in these two cases is different and easily confused.

This diagnostic is only reported for public members that are static and not a constant.
