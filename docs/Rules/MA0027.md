# MA0027 - Prefer rethrowing an exception implicitly

When an exception is rethrown explicitly (i.e. by specifying it), the original stack trace will be lost, replaced by a new one.
To preserve the original call stack, rethrow the exception implicitly (i.e. without specifying it).

```csharp
try
{
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    throw ex;
}

// Should be
try
{
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    throw;
}
```
