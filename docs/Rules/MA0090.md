# MA0090 - Remove empty else/finally block

This rule detects empty `else` and `finally` blocks that contain no executable code and suggests removing them to improve code readability and reduce clutter. Empty blocks serve no functional purpose and can make code harder to read by adding unnecessary visual noise.

## Non-compliant code

### Empty else block

````csharp
if (condition)
{
    DoSomething();
}
else
{
    // This empty else block should be removed
}
````

### Empty finally block

````csharp
try
{
    DoSomething();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    HandleException(ex);
}
finally
{
    // This empty finally block should be removed
}
````

## Compliant code

### Remove unnecessary else block

````csharp
if (condition)
{
    DoSomething();
}
// else block removed - code is cleaner and more readable
````

### Remove unnecessary finally block

````csharp
try
{
    DoSomething();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    HandleException(ex);
}
// finally block removed - no cleanup needed
````

## When the rule does NOT apply

The rule will not trigger in the following scenarios:

### Blocks with comments

````csharp
if (condition)
{
    DoSomething();
}
else
{
    // TODO: Implement this feature later
    // This block contains comments, so it won't be flagged
}
````

### Blocks with preprocessor directives

````csharp
try
{
    DoSomething();
}
finally
{
#if DEBUG
    // Preprocessor directives prevent the rule from triggering
#endif
}
````

### Finally blocks with actual cleanup code

````csharp
try
{
    DoSomething();
}
finally
{
    resource?.Dispose(); // Actual cleanup code - rule doesn't apply
}
````

## Why remove empty blocks?

Removing empty `else` and `finally` blocks improves code quality in several ways:

- **Reduces visual noise**: Empty blocks add no value but consume screen space and mental processing
- **Improves readability**: Cleaner code is easier to scan and understand
- **Follows clean code principles**: Empty constructs violate the principle of intentional and meaningful code
- **Prevents confusion**: Empty blocks might make other developers wonder if code was accidentally removed

## Configuration

By default, this rule has a severity of `suggestion`. You can configure the severity in your `.editorconfig` file:

````ini
# Disable the rule
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0090.severity = none

# Set as suggestion (default)
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0090.severity = suggestion

# Set as warning
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0090.severity = warning

# Set as error
dotnet_diagnostic.MA0090.severity = error
````
