# MA0060 - The value returned by Stream.Read is not used

You should use the value of `Stream.Read` to know how many bytes where actually read. This can be less than the number of bytes requested if that many bytes are not currently available, or zero if the end of the stream has been reached.

````csharp
class Test
{
    void A()
    {
        var stream = File.OpenRead("file.txt");
        var bytes = new byte[10];
        stream.Read(bytes, 0, bytes.Length); // Noncompliant
    }
}
