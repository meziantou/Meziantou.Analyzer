# MA0056 - Do not call overridable methods in constructors

When a virtual method is called, the actual type that executes the method is not selected until run time. When a constructor calls a virtual method, it's possible that the constructor for the instance that invokes the method has not executed.

````csharp
class Sample
{
    public Sample()
    {
        VirtualMethod(); // Non compliant
    }

    protected virtual void VirtualMethod()
    {
    }
}
