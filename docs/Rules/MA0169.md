# MA0169 - Use Equals method instead of operator

When a type overrides the `Equals` method, but does not define the equality operators, using `==` or `!=` will do a reference comparison. This can lead to unexpected behavior, as the `Equals` method may be overridden to provide a value comparison. This rule is to ensure that the `Equals` method is used.

````c#
Sample a = default;
Sample b = default;

_ = a == b; // ok, Equals is not overridden

class Sample { }
````

````c#
Sample a = default;
Sample b = default;

_ = a == b; // ok, the equality operator are defined


class Sample
{
    public static bool operator ==(Sample a, Sample b) => true;
    public static bool operator !=(Sample a, Sample b) => false;
    public override bool Equals(object obj) => true;
    public override int GetHashCode() => 0;
}
````

````c#
Sample a = default;
Sample b = default;

_ = a.Equals(b); // ok
_ = object.Reference`Equals(a, b); // ok
_ = a == b; // non-compliant

class Sample
{
    public override bool Equals(object obj) => true;
    public override int GetHashCode() => 0;
}
