# MA0169 - Use Equals method instead of operator

Using `==` or `!=` operator on a type that overrides `Equals` method, but not the operators, is not recommended.

````c#
Sample a = default;
Sample b = default;

_ = a == b; // ok as Equals is not overrided

class Sample { }
````

````c#
Sample a = default;
Sample b = default;

_ = a == b; // ok the equality operator are defined


class Sample
{
    public static bool operator ==(Sample a, Sample b) => true;
    public static bool operator !=(Sample a, Sample b) => false;
    public override bool Equals(object obj) => true;
    public override int GetHashCode() => 0;
}
````

````c#
Sample a = default;
Sample b = default;

_ = a.Equals(b); // ok
_ = object.Reference`Equals(a, b); // ok
_ = a == b; // non-compliant 

class Sample
{
    public override bool Equals(object obj) => true;
    public override int GetHashCode() => 0;
}
````
