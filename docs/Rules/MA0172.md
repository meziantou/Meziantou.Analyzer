# MA0172 - Both sides of the logical operation are identical

This rule triggers when both sides of a logical operation (such as `&&`, `||`, `&`, `|`, `==`, `!=`, or pattern matching operations) are identical. This usually indicates a mistake or redundant code.

```csharp
_ = x == x; // non-compliant
_ = x is true or true; // non-compliant
```
