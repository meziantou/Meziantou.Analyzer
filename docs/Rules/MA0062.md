# MA0062 - Non-flags enums should not be marked with "FlagsAttribute"

An enumeration marked with `FlagsAttribute` should only contain members whose values are powers of two or a combination of such members.

````csharp
[Flags] // Non-compliant, as 'Orange' is neither a power of two, nor a bitwise combination of existing "power of two" members
public enum Color
{
    None    = 0,
    Red     = 1,
    Orange  = 3,
    Yellow  = 4,
}
````
