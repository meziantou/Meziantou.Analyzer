# MA0016 - Prefer return collection abstraction instead of implementation

Public methods that returns a collection implementation, such as List<T> HashSet<T> or Dictionary<TKey,TValue>, or have a parameter of one of these types.

Most often than not, clients of a method don't need to know the exact implementation of the collection returned.
It is preferable to return a collection interface such as `IReadOnlyList<T>`, `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`, `IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey,TValue>`, `IList<T>`, `ICollection<T>`, `IEnumerable<T>` or `IDictionary<TKey,TValue>`.
