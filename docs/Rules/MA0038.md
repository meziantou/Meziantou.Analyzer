# MA0038 - Make method static (deprecated, use CA1822 instead)

> **Warning**
> This rule is deprecated and will be removed in the future. It's recommended to use use [CA1822](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1822?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003978) instead.

If the method only uses static or const members, you should consider making the method static.
