# MA0023 - Add RegexOptions.ExplicitCapture

Using named groups clarifies what is to be captured. It also makes the regex more performant, as unnamed groups will not be captured needlessly.

````c#
new Regex("a(b)"); // non-compliant
new Regex("a(b)", RegexOptions.ExplicitCapture); // ok
new Regex("a(?<name>b)"); // ok
````
