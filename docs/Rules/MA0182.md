# MA0182 - Avoid uninstantiated internal classes

This analyzer detects internal classes that are never instantiated or referenced.


## How to fix violations

1. If the class is truly unused, remove it from the codebase.
2. If the class contains only static members, make it `static`.
3. If the class is used via generic type arguments, typeof(), or other reflection mechanisms, the analyzer correctly recognizes this and won't report a diagnostic.
