# MA0166 - Forward the TimeProvider to methods that take one

You should pass a `System.TimeProvider` when calling a method if there is an overload of the method that supports it.

````csharp
class Test
{
    public void A(System.TimeProvider timeProvider)
    {
        Task.Delay(default(TimeSpan)); // non-compliant
        Task.Delay(default(TimeSpan), timeProvider); // compliant
    }
}
````

This rule only reports a diagnostic when a `System.TimeProvider` is available in the scope. [MA0167](MA0167.md) detects the same cases, but reports them even if applying a fix would require you to change the calling method's signature.
