# MA0048 - File name must match type name

The name of the class must match to name of the file. This rule has two main reasons:
- When there is only one type in the file, it ensures the type name is the same as the file name. This prevents renaming a type without renaming the file.
- When you navigate in the code without an IDE, such as GitHub, GitLab or most web interfaces, you can quickly find the file that you are insterested in.
