# MA0051 - Method is too long

Long methods are harder to understand. You should refactor them when possible.

You can configure the rule using an `.editorconfig` file:

````editorconfig
MA0051.maximum_lines_per_method = 60
MA0051.maximum_statements_per_method = 40
MA0051.skip_local_functions = false # skip local functions when counting statements
````
