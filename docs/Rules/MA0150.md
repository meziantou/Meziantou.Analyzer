# MA0150 - Do not call the default object.ToString explicitly

Report when `ToString` is called on an instance of a type that doesn't override `ToString`:

```c#
object o = ...;
o.ToString(); // compliant as ToString may be overridden

var o = new Foo();
o.ToString(); // Non-compliant as Foo doesn't override ToString and is sealed

sealed class Foo {}
```
