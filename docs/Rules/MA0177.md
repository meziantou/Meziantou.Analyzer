# MA0177 - Use single-line XML comment syntax when possible

This rule reports XML documentation comments that span multiple lines but contain only single-line content. Such comments can be more concisely written on a single line for better readability.

````csharp
/// <summary>
/// This is a description
/// </summary>
public class Sample { }

// Should be
/// <summary>This is a description</summary>
public class Sample { }
````

## When to use single-line format

The analyzer will suggest converting to single-line format when:
- The XML element spans multiple lines
- The element contains only a single line of actual text content (ignoring whitespace)
- The resulting single-line comment would fit within the `max_line_length` configuration (if set)

## When NOT to use single-line format

The analyzer will NOT suggest converting when:
- The element already uses single-line format
- The element contains multiple lines of text content
- The element contains CDATA sections
- The element contains nested XML elements (like `<c>`, `<see>`, etc.)
- The single-line version would exceed the `max_line_length` setting

## Configuration

The analyzer respects the `max_line_length` setting from your `.editorconfig` file:

````editorconfig
[*.cs]
max_line_length = 120
````

If the single-line version of the XML comment would exceed this limit, the analyzer will not report a diagnostic.

## Examples

````csharp
// Non-compliant: Single-line content on multiple lines
/// <summary>
/// Returns the sum of two numbers
/// </summary>
public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;

// Compliant: Single line
/// <summary>Returns the sum of two numbers</summary>
public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;

// Compliant: Multiple lines of actual content
/// <summary>
/// Returns the sum of two numbers.
/// This method handles integer overflow.
/// </summary>
public int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;

// Compliant: Contains nested XML element
/// <summary>
/// Returns the sum using <see cref="Add"/> method
/// </summary>
public int Calculate(int a, int b) => Add(a, b);

// Compliant: Contains CDATA section
/// <summary><![CDATA[
/// Special content with <markup>
/// ]]></summary>
public void Process() { }
````
