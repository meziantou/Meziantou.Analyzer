`Meziantou.Analyzer.Annotations` helps configuring some rules by annotating your code.

All usages of Meziantou.Analyzer.Annotations attributes are erased from metadata by default, which means no actual binary reference to 'Meziantou.Analyzer.Annotations.dll' assembly is produced. If you need to preserve these attributes in metadata, just define 'MEZIANTOU_ANALYZER_ANNOTATIONS' conditional compilation symbol in your projects.
